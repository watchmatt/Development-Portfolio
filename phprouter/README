This is a sample of a site that allows users to login with different levels of credentials and also search a database for books by author and title. It also redirects users off certain pages depending on if the user is logged in, whther they are admin or not, and if they are attempting to view a page they should not. It is not a fully functioning site, just one to showcase certain skills.
